# 📖 Ensemble — Complete Documentation

> **Build, orchestrate, and govern teams of AI agents with a no-code visual studio, local LLMs, and human-in-the-loop controls.**

**Current Version**: v1.5  
**Last Updated**: April 2026

---

## 🏢 What is Ensemble?

**Ensemble** is a desktop application and backend platform that lets you architect entire **Specialized AI Departments** — groups of AI agents that collaborate to solve complex business objectives. Instead of managing a single chatbot, you build multi-agent workflows with drag-and-drop, monitor their execution in real-time, and enforce budget controls with human approval checkpoints.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

> **Code = SOP (Team)** — Every workflow is a Standard Operating Procedure executed by a team of agents. Each agent has a specific role, and together they accomplish complex tasks that no single agent could handle alone.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Ensemble operates on a **3-Layer Architecture**:

### Layer 1: Directive (The DNA)
- **Component:** SOP YAML files / `directives/`
- **Purpose:** Define Standard Operating Procedures as Finite State Machines (FSM)
- **Function:** Roles, state transitions, required inputs, and expected artifacts

### Layer 2: Orchestration (The Brain)
- **Component:** `SOPEngine` & `ManagedAgent`
- **Purpose:** Intelligent routing and decision-making
- **Function:** Reads SOPs, manages budgets (Token Grants), communicates via EnsembleSpace

### Layer 3: Execution (The Tools)
- **Component:** Python scripts in `execution/` and `core/tools/`
- **Purpose:** Deterministic doing — API calls, file operations, data processing
- **Function:** Every execution is intercepted by the AuditLogger for transparency

## ✨ Working Features

### 1. 🏠 Personal Dashboard
**What it does:** The central hub showing real-time system status.

| Section | Data Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Stats Cards** (Active Workflows, Agents Running, Tokens Today, Monthly Cost) | Real backend queries (`/api/dashboard/stats`) | ✅ Working |
| **Live Pipelines** | Execution table (`/api/dashboard/pipeline-status`) | ✅ Working |
| **Recent Activity Feed** | Audit events from SQLite (`/api/dashboard/activity`) | ✅ Working |
| **Top Agents Leaderboard** | Agent performance stats (`/api/dashboard/agent-stats`) | ✅ Working |
| **Token Usage Chart** (7-day bar chart) | Historical event data (`/api/dashboard/token-usage`) | ✅ Working |
| **Recent Workflows Table** | Workflows + executions join (`/api/dashboard/workflows`) | ✅ Working |

**Smart behavior:**
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Shows professional empty states when no data exists
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Trend indicators (up/down arrows with color coding)

---

### 2. 🎨 Visual Workflow Canvas (Workflow Studio)
**What it does:** A React Flow-powered drag-and-drop canvas for building multi-agent workflows.

#### Features:
- **Add Agents** — Choose from 186+ pre-built specialist agents (code reviewer, architect, PM, etc.)
- **Connect Nodes** — Draw directed edges between agents to define execution order
- **Node Inspector** — Click any node to edit its model, temperature, and prompt
- **Save/Load** — Persist workflows to SQLite database
- **Delete Nodes** — Remove agents with one click (red ✕ button on hover)
- **Auto-layout** — Nodes are positioned intelligently on the canvas

#### AI Workflow Generator ("AI Generate"):
- **How it works:** Describe what you need in natural language → the system generates a complete workflow graph
- **Fallback:** If the LLM generation fails, it falls back to keyword matching with 186+ agent templates
- **Auto-execution:** After generation, the execution panel opens with your prompt pre-filled

---

### 3. ▶️ Workflow Execution Engine
**What it does:** Runs multi-agent DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) sequentially through the backend.

#### How execution works:
1. **User types task** → Clicks "Run Workflow"
2. **Auto-save** → The workflow graph is saved to the database and gets a real ID
3. **Backend execution** → `DAGWorkflowEngine` processes each node in topological order
4. **Agent creation** → Each node spawns a `ManagedAgent` with its role-specific skill file
5. **LLM calls** → Agents execute their tasks via Gemini (or local Ollama)
6. **Artifacts** → Output, code blocks, and handover summaries are committed to CAS storage
7. **Results** → Markdown output + extracted files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) returned to frontend

#### Execution Panel States:
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Input** | User enters task description, optionally attaches files |
| **Running** | Agent step tracker shows each agent's progress in real-time |
| **Complete** | Shows markdown output, generated files, and live HTML preview |

---

### 4. 📊 Workflow List Page
**What it does:** Gallery view of all saved workflows with status indicators.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Correct Agent Count** | Parses `graph_json` to count actual nodes per workflow | ✅ Working |
| **Re-run Button** | ↻ icon — opens workflow editor with execution panel ready | ✅ Working |
| **Delete Button** | 🗑️ icon — removes workflow from database (with toast confirmation) | ✅ Working |
| **Green Glow** | Border ring + shadow for workflows with successful output | ✅ Working |
| **Red Glow** | Border ring + shadow for failed workflows | ✅ Working |
| **Status Badges** | "✓ Completed" or "✗ Failed" shown alongside agent count | ✅ Working |
| **Search** | Filter workflows by name | ✅ Working |
| **Uniform Card Size** | All cards are the same height (180px minimum) | ✅ Working |

---

### 5. 💾 Workflow Output Persistence
**What it does:** Workflow results survive tab switches and page refreshes.

#### How it works:
1. **On completion** → Output is saved to `localStorage` under the workflow's real ID
2. **On tab switch** → Execution state (phase, task, output, steps) is persisted
3. **On return** → Panel re-opens with the same state restored
4. **On page refresh** → Output page reloads from `localStorage` fallback

#### What's restored:
- Phase (input / running / complete)
- Original task/prompt
- Markdown output from all agents
- Generated files list
- Step history (agent names and statuses)

---

### 6. 🔍 Web Search Tool (DuckDuckGo)
**What it does:** Agents can search the web for real-time information.

- **Provider:** DuckDuckGo (via `duckduckgo_search` Python library)
- **Cost:** Free, unlimited queries
- **Setup:** No API key required — works out of the box
- **Format:** Returns Title, URL, and Snippet for each result
- **Fallback:** Returns friendly error message if search fails

**Note:** Previously used Google Custom Search API and Tavily, both replaced with DuckDuckGo for simplicity.

---

### 7. 🏛️ Governance System
**What it does:** Enforces budget controls, human approvals, and audit logging.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cost Thresholds** | Configurable cost limits per approval (set in `.env`) |
| **Human Approval** | Sensitive actions (shell commands, file deletion, email, deploy) require manual approval |
| **Budget Tracking** | Per-agent monthly spend tracking with escrow system |
| **Audit Log** | Every action recorded to SQLite with timestamps, costs, and CAS hashes |
| **Panic Button** | Universal abort — snapshots state, kills sessions, generates forensics report |
| **Timeout Monitor** | Approval requests expire after configurable timeout (default: 300s) |

---

### 8. 🗂️ Tab System
**What it does:** Browser-like tab navigation for the entire app.

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Open apps as tabs | ✅ Working |
| Close tabs (non-essential) | ✅ Working |
| Persist tabs across sessions | ✅ Working |
| Tab URL updates (workflow-specific) | ✅ Working — tab shows current workflow name when editing |
| Re-open closed workflow on tab click | ✅ Working — tab navigates to last-opened workflow |

---

### 9. 📁 Skill Registry (186+ Specialist Agents)
**What it does:** A directory of pre-built AI agents organized by category.

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Engineering** | Code Reviewer, Test Analyzer, Security Engineer, Frontend Developer, DevOps Automator |
| **Design** | UI Designer, Visual Storyteller, UX Researcher |
| **Marketing** | Content Creator, SEO Specialist, Social Media Manager |
| **Product** | Product Manager, Trend Researcher, Business Analyst |
| **Game Dev** | Narrative Designer, Level Designer |
| **Support** | Analytics Reporter, Customer Support Specialist |

Each agent has:
- A markdown skill file with role description and system prompt
- Assigned tools (search_web, read_url, write_artifact, etc.)
- Category and emoji for visual identification

---

### 10. 📤 Output Viewer (3 Tabs)
**What it does:** Displays workflow execution results in three viewing modes.

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Document** | Rendered markdown with copy-to-clipboard and download buttons |
| **Files** | VS Code-style file tree with expandable folders, content viewer, and per-file download |
| **Preview** | Live HTML rendering in iframe with "Open in tab" button |

**Smart behavior:**
- Auto-selects the best tab based on available output types
- HTML files go to Preview tab, markdown to Document tab
- Non-HTML code files appear in Files tab with syntax coloring

---

### 11. 🔐 Security & Privacy
**What it does:** Keep your data on-premises with no vendor lock-in.

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Local LLMs** | Supports Ollama (qwen, llama3, mistral, etc.) for 100% offline operation |
| **Cloud LLMs** | Google Gemini (configurable model via `.env`) |
| **Data Storage** | SQLite databases — no cloud dependencies |
| **No Telemetry** | Zero external tracking or analytics |
| **File Sandboxing** | All file operations restricted to `data/workspace/` directory |
| **CSP Protection** | Content Security Policy headers prevent unauthorized external connections |

---

### 12. 🌍 Universal Agent Platform
**What it does:** Import and run agents in ANY format natively (Markdown, Python, YAML, JSON, Text).

#### Features:
- **Universal Importer** — Paste ANY GitHub repository URL to automatically discover, analyze, and import agent packs.
- **Multi-Format Support** — Native execution for:
  - **Markdown (.md)**: Traditional prompt-based agents.
  - **Python (.py)**: Complex agents with custom logic (MetaGPT/CrewAI style).
  - **YAML/JSON**: Configuration-driven agents (LangChain/AutoGen style).
  - **Plain Text**: Simple prompt files.
- **Format Detection** — AST-based scanning automatically identifies agent classes and manifests in repositories.
- **Native Runners** — High-performance execution engines that run agents in their original format without conversion.

---

### 13. 🛡️ Advanced Security Hardening
**What it does:** Multi-layered defense-in-depth for running untrusted agent code.

| Layer | Component | Protection |
|---|---|---|
| **Layer 1** | **Docker Sandboxing** | Ephemeral, hardened containers with no Docker socket access and read-only filesystems. |
| **Layer 2** | **AST Guard** | Python code analyzer blocks dangerous built-ins (`eval`, `exec`, `__import__`) and modules (`os`, `subprocess`). |
| **Layer 3** | **Network Policy** | Enforces domain whitelisting via iptables to prevent data exfiltration. |
| **Layer 4** | **Recursion Guard** | Prevents infinite agent-to-agent call loops (hard limit of 3 levels). |
| **Layer 5** | **Storage Quotas** | Limits per-user disk usage and blocks expensive/massive dependencies (Tensorflow, etc.). |

---

### 14. 💰 Economic Governance (Cost Control)
**What it does:** Deterministic limits on AI spending and resource usage.

- **Input Limiter** — Automatically truncates LLM inputs at 8,000 tokens with smart summarization.
- **Timeout Manager** — Hard enforcement of execution time (default 60s) with precise billing.
- **Budget Enforcer** — Multi-level escrow system for per-agent, per-workflow, and monthly spending caps.
- **Concurrency Manager** — Tier-based parallel execution limits with fair-scheduling FIFO queues.
